# Changelog

New updates and changes to Fuzzy Brain.

## v0.4.0

Jul 9, 2026

**Tools**

- Added the brain companion: talk the way you would to someone who remembers everything, and your thoughts become nodes as the conversation goes -- no form to fill out. It loads your whole brain, opens by picking up where you left off, runs the structure pass on what you share, and offers connections for you to approve before anything is linked.
- Added `scripts/brain.mjs`, the tool the companion runs on: `index` for the whole brain at a glance, `show` for the full text of a node on demand, and `add-node` / `add-edge` for writing, with the database "why" rule as the final gate.

## v0.3.0

Jul 8, 2026

**Tools**

- Added "the space" (tools/space): a full-screen studio that turns any photo into an anamorphic portrait, plus a 3D space you can fly through where portraits sit in a ring. It runs on its own, separate from the main brain map, so the brain stays the default.
- Fly with the arrow keys or WASD, and hold shift with up or down to rise and fall.
- "Go to nearest portrait" now carries you all the way to a crisp head-on view of the closest face; leaving that view eases you right up to the face instead of dropping you far away.
- Portraits can be deleted, each carries a numbered sign you can navigate to, and they are saved in the browser so they survive a reload.

## v0.2.0

Jul 8, 2026

**Face**

- Added the anamorphic face-reveal view: a 3D point cloud built from a real photo, where each node lights exactly one point in the actual face.
- Strung faint connection lines between lit points, so existing whys stay visible in the face view too.
- Made the face view the default view on load; the map is one toggle away.

**Map**

- Rebuilt the map as a 3D force graph with drag-to-rotate orbit controls and scroll to zoom.
- Restored springy drag physics so pulling a node visibly drags its connections along.
- Eased the camera toward a clicked node while its detail panel opens.

**UI**

- Removed the animated galaxy background in favor of a solid night sky.
- Added a motion pass: a tweened camera snap on "front", slow idle drift on the face view, staggered fades on load, a breathing halo on the selected node, and hover tooltips with a brief of the node body.
- Made all movement respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; buttons now acknowledge presses with a subtle scale.

**Tools**

- Added `tools/face-scatter.html`, a local, offline studio that turns a photo into the face-reveal point cloud, with a live 3D preview and tunable spacing, scatter depth, brightness, and contrast.
- Committed the ratified portrait asset (3,809 points).

**Docs**

- Wrote the face-reveal design spec, covering the full path from MediaPipe face landmarks to the final anamorphic-scatter approach.

## v0.1.2

Jul 7, 2026

**Docs**

- Proposed "The Ratified Galaxy" brain architecture: a machine-suggests, human-decides model for connections and abstraction layers. Not yet approved for build.

---

## v0.1.1

Jul 4, 2026

**Docs**

- Documented the ritual: nodes are raw capture, not polished artifacts.

---

## v0.1.0

Jul 2, 2026

**Data**

- Added the Polygres data layer: schema, a connection pool cached across dev reloads, and `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/graph`.
- Added integration tests that run against the real database inside rolled-back transactions.

**Map**

- Built the first map: a force-directed 2D graph with glow, a detail panel, and a type legend.

**API**

- Added in-app node creation: an add-node panel and `POST /api/nodes`.
- Allowed `127.0.0.1` as a dev origin.
- Made node type optional, so untyped capture stays first-class.

**UI**

- Added the animated galaxy background (removed in v0.2.0).
